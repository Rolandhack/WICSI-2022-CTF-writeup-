after having unzipped the file there are several possibilities to open it either via the terminal or by opening it via the folder in the file explorer, in my case I open it via your terminal, the first folder I I chose open I found the flag in there, but the best thing is to open it via the folder, I found the flag in the word folder precisely in the document.xml file
to display what is inside the document.xml file I just did a cat document.xml but you have to make sure that you are in the word folder
